An open-source google-docs type website dedicated to supporting a real-time typing learning environment. Can type and share links to as many people as possible for typing togethor. 


**Hosting**
- https://raste.herokuapp.com/

**Motivation**
- Tired of having to email myself and friends code/assignments via text or having to send myself a email containing all the information I need. Just wanted a quick link to be able to share the data. Think of it as a plain and colorful pastebin and google docs hybrid.

**Usability**:
- share raste link
- use it for a bit and code with buddies, all at the same time
